Wai'anae Landcover
The Nonpoint Source Pollution and Erosion Comparison Tool (N-SPECT)
was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) Coastal Services Center to accompany the Wai'anae Ecological
Characterization being developed by the Hawaii Coastal Zone
Management (CZM) program.  N-SPECT examines the relationship between
land cover, nonpoint source pollution, and erosion.  N-SPECT is an
extension to Environmental Systems Research Institutes (ESRI) ArcGIS
software package, version 8.3 and requires the Spatial Analyst
extension.  N-SPECT is designed to be portable to any watershed,
provided the user has access to the necessary data. Data provided
with N-SPECT are for the Wai'anae ahupua'a, the original study area
located on the western side of Oahu, Hawaii.  The Wai'anae ahupua'a
is the collection of catchments that drain the Wai'anae mountains
westward to the Wai'anae coast (west coast of Oahu, HI), including
Kaluakauila, Makua, Keaau, Makaha, Kaupuni, Kamaileunu, Mailiili,
Ulehawa, and Nanakuli.  The Landcover data file is a grid that
represents different land cover classes as determined by the NOAA
Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP).
</abstract>
			<purpose>
This data set was created to provide resource managers working in the
Wai'anae Ahupua'a with an accurate representation of land cover
classes.  Land cover data is the basis of N-SPECT’s functionality.
Land cover is used to estimate pollutant loads by applying
coefficients for each pollutant to each land cover classification.

A team of field investigators participated in data verification exercises
in June 2001.  Data validation teams consisted of personnel from the NOAA
Coastal Services Center and Hawaii Dept. of Forestry and Wildlife.  The team
was equipped with a portable color laptop computer linked to a Global
Positioning System (GPS). The field computer runs software that supports
the classified data as a raster background with the road network as a vector
overlay with a simultaneous display of live GPS coordinates. Accuracy
assessment points were generated with ERDAS Imagine software using a stratified
random sample in 3x3 pixel homogeneous windows. To make the acquisition of the
field reference data more practical, a twenty pixel buffer area around roads
(i.e. 10 pixels on each side of the road) was created. 5,000 random points
were generated within this area for the accuracy assessment. Out of these 5,000 points
353 were visitred for accuracy verification procedures.

Pre-Processing Steps:
Reprojected from Albers Equal Area Conic to UTM
NAD 1983

Ancillary data sets:
MAjor and Minor Roads from HI DNLR, Wetlands from HI DNLR,
10 meter DEM from USGS, 1-3 meter black/white 1997 DOQ data derived from
multiple sources, Agricultural Lands from HI DNLR.

Shoreline features can be extracted from Landsat images by
detecting the land/water interface.  However, care must be used
to avoid misinterpreting tidal differences as changes in
shorelines, since the satellite images from which these land
cover images are derived and acquired at different tidal stages,
depending on when the satellite is overhead. The land cover
classifications represent the instantaneous state of the
shoreline at the moment of image acquisition.
C-CAP data are mapped at 1:100,000 scale with 22 standard
classes constituting major landscape components. They are not
jurisdictional (can't be used for permitting) and will not
identify individual species. However, they are useful for
identifying regional landscape patterns, major functional
niches, environmental impact assessment, urban planning, and
zoning applications. If you need change analysis data at this
scale, C-CAP may be your only option. C-CAP is designed around a
1 to 5 year revisit cycle.
Land Cover is the complete human and natural landscape recorded
as surface components - forest, water, wetlands, concrete,
asphalt, etc. Land cover can be documented by analyzing spectral
signatures of satellite and aerial imagery.
Land Use is the documentation of human uses of the landscape -
residential, commercial, agricultural, etc. Land use can be
inferred but, not explicitly derived from satellite and aerial
imagery. There is no spectral basis for land use determination
in satellite imagery.
C-CAP data can be used to identify concrete and asphalt as land
cover, but we can only infer that these materials denote a
residential or commercial use.

Post-Processing Steps:
None

Known Problems:
The combination of tropical latitudes, steep
topography, and large bodies of open water
contribute to frequent cloud cover in the Hawaiian
Islands.  While ETM imagery was selected to
minimize the amount of cloud cover, multiple scene
dates were still required to map each island.  In
some cases no clear imagery was available for
portions of the land surface, therefore an
unclassified category is included.
Accuracy Results:

This data set was found to be 94.9%
accurate with a kappa coefficient of agreement
equal to .94
</attraccr>
		</attracc>
		<logic>
Tests for logical consistency indicate that all row and column positions
in the selected latitude/longitude window contain data. Conversion and
integration with vector files indicates that all positions are
consistent with earth coordinates covering the same area. Attribute
files appear to be logically consistent.
</logic>
		<complete>
The classification scheme comprehensively includes all anticipated land
covers, however, not all pixels have been classified. The NOAA Coastal Change
Analysis Program (C-CAP): Guidance for Regional Implementation, NOAA
National Marine Fisheries Service Report 123, discusses the interagency
effort to develop the land cover classification scheme and defines all
categories.

The processing steps for each C-CAP Hawaii Land Cover, Oahu
Island product are intricately associated. Each
database is the result of many processing steps with numerous
iterations for each step. The output of one processing step or
database is often the input data for another processing
step. A brief description of the processing steps used in the
land cover classification of the this project follows. Further
description of the processing steps can be found in the NOAA
Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP): Guidance for Regional
Implementation, NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service Report
123 (Dobson et al, 1995).
Baseline Classification Process:
The Hawaii Oahu Island land cover product was processed using an iterative
classification approach.  Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper data
for path/row/dates: 664/46 1-27-00, 64/45 7-3-99, 64/45 2-28-00,
64/45 2-12-00 were analyzed to create a land cover for the island
of Oahu.  Each scene was individually classified, focusing first
on separating major categories (e.g. water, forest, marsh, herbaceous
upland, and developed) using standard supervised classification techniques.
Through field work in December 2000 numerous individual areas were
chosen as training sites for the land cover classification.  The
mean and covariance statistics for these areas are passed to an
isodata classification algorithm that assigns an unknown pixel to
the class in which it has the highest probability of being a member.
Then iterative unsupervised classifications were performed on each
major category individually by masking out all other major categories.
With this type of unsupervised classification, the computer is allowed
to query the multispectral properties of the masked scene using user
specified criteria and to identify X mutually exclusive clusters in
N-dimensional feature space.  By masking out all data but a single
major category, the spectral variance is greatly reduced thus decreasing
classification errors.  After several classification iterations of the
masked data, final classification labels were assigned to the spectral clusters.
Changes among major categories were permitted to occur even at this stage of
processing.  Subsequent field work and the use of collateral data such as
multiple source DOQs, TIGER road data, wetlands from HI DLNR, and 10 Meter
DEMs from USGS led to further refinements in the image classification.
In small areas where landcover class confusion could not be separated spectrally,
human pattern recognition was used to recode the data.

						<edomv>15 Estuarine Emergent</edomv>
						<edomvd>
Characterized by erect, rooted, herbaceous hydrophytes
(excluding mosses and lichens) that are present for most
of the growing season in most years. Perennial plants
usually dominate these wetlands. All water regimes are
included except those that are subtidal and irregularly
exposed.

						<edomv>16 Unconsolidated Shore</edomv>
						<edomvd>
Characterized by substrates lacking vegetation except for
pioneering plants that become established during brief
periods when growing conditions are favorable. Erosion and
deposition by waves and currents produce a number of
landforms, such as beaches, bars, and flats, all of which
are included in this class.
