# OpenNSPECT Codeplex to GitHub Port
### 1 November, 2017

This repository is a complete port of the source code, issues, and any discussions from
[nspect.codeplex.com](nspect.codeplex.com) of the OpenNSPECT project in preparation for the Codeplex site shutting down.  As such, it contains some extraneous code and directories that were accumulated over the 9-year development life on Codeplex.  They have been kept, however, for completeness.  The most current, meaningful code is in **Source/OpenNSPECT** and **Installer/OpenNSPECT**.


This also represents the last expected updates to the [MapWindow 4.8](http://mapwindow4.codeplex.com/) version of OpenNSPECT.

Future plans for OpenNSPECT are to move to the QGIS and/or GRASS platforms.  Although there is no specific schedule for when that work will begin, a link to the new repository will be added to this page when it does.

For comments and/or questions, please contact dave.eslinger@noaa.gov.
