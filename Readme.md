# OpenNSPECT Port from 1 November, 2017

This repository is a complete port of the source code, issues, and any discussions from 
[nspect.codeplex.com](nspect.codeplex.com) of the OpenNSPECT project at the time of Codeplex site shutting down.

This also represents the last intended updates to the MapWindow 4.8.8 version of OpenNSPECT.

Future plans for OpenNSPECT are to move to the QGIS and/or GRASS platforms.  As that work begins, a link will be added to this page.

For comments and/or questions, please contact dave.eslinger@noaa.gov.
