# OpenNSPECT Codeplex to GitHub Port 
## 1 November, 2017

This repository is a complete port of the source code, issues, and any discussions from 
[nspect.codeplex.com](nspect.codeplex.com) of the OpenNSPECT project in preparation for the Codeplex site shutting down.

This also represents the last expected updates to the [MapWindow 4.8](http://mapwindow4.codeplex.com/) version of OpenNSPECT.

Future plans for OpenNSPECT are to move to the QGIS and/or GRASS platforms.  Although there is no specific schdule for when that work will begin, a link will be added to this page when it does.

For comments and/or questions, please contact dave.eslinger@noaa.gov.
